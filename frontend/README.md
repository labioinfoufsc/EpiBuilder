# epibuilder-frontend

The `epibuilder-frontend` is the graphical user interface for the `epibuilder-core` project, developed using Angular 12. This repository contains the source code for the frontend part of the application.

## Requirements

To contribute to the project, you'll need to set up your local environment. Here are the requirements to run the project:

- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)
- **NPM** (Node.js package manager)
- **Angular CLI** (version 12 or higher)

### Install Node.js and NPM

1. **Download Node.js**:
   - For **Windows** and **macOS**, go to the [Node.js download page](https://nodejs.org/) and download the appropriate installer for your operating system.
   - For **Linux**, you can install Node.js using a package manager, depending on your distribution. For example:
     - **Ubuntu/Debian**:
       ```bash
       sudo apt update
       sudo apt install nodejs npm
       ```
     - **CentOS/RHEL**:
       ```bash
       sudo yum install nodejs npm
       ```
     - **macOS** (via Homebrew):
       ```bash
       brew install node
       ```

2. The Node.js installation includes NPM (Node Package Manager), so you donâ€™t need to install it separately.

3. **Verify the installation**:
   After installation, open a terminal (or Command Prompt on Windows) and run the following commands to verify that Node.js and NPM are installed correctly:

   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v

### Install Angular CLI

If you don't have Angular CLI installed, you can install it by running the following command:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli@12
```
