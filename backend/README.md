# epibuilder-backend

The `epibuilder-backend` is a Spring Boot application that serves as the backend for the `epibuilder-frontend` project. It provides an API, and also integrates with **Nextflow** for running bioinformatics workflow.

## Requirements

To contribute to the project, you'll need to set up your local environment. Here are the requirements to run the project:

- **JDK 21** (Java Development Kit)
- **Maven** (Build automation tool)
- **Spring Boot** (The project is built using Spring Boot)
- **Nextflow** (for executing bioinformatics workflows)

### Install JDK

1. **Windows / macOS**: Download and install JDK from [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) or [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).
2. **Linux**: You can install JDK using your package manager. For example:
   - **Ubuntu/Debian**:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
     ```
   - **CentOS/RHEL**:
     ```bash
     sudo yum install java-11-openjdk-devel
     ```

To verify that Java is installed correctly, run the following command:

```bash
java -version
```

### Install Maven

1. **Windows / macOS / Linux**: Download and install Maven from [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
2. **Linux**: You can install Maven using your package manager. For example:
   - **Ubuntu/Debian**:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install maven
     ```
   - **CentOS/RHEL**:
     ```bash
     sudo yum install maven
     ```

To verify that Maven is installed correctly, run the following command:

```bash
mvn -v
```

### Install Nextflow

To run bioinformatics workflows, **Nextflow** must be installed. Follow the instructions on the [Nextflow installation page](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html) for your platform.

For example, on Linux or macOS, you can install Nextflow via `curl`:

```bash
curl -s https://get.nextflow.io | bash
```

For Windows, use the [Windows installation instructions](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html#installing-nextflow).

To verify that Nextflow is installed correctly, run:

```bash
nextflow -v
```

## Running the Project Locally

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bioinformatics-ufsc/epibuilder-backend.git
```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

```bash
cd epibuilder-backend
```

3. **Build the project using Maven**:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

4. **Run the application**:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The backend will start and you can interact with it via the exposed APIs.

5. **Test the Nextflow Integration**:

The backend interacts with Nextflow for running workflows. Ensure that you have Nextflow installed and configured properly before testing workflow execution. You can trigger a workflow execution via the backend's API.
